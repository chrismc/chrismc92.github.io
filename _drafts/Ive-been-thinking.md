I've been thinking lately. A dangerous habit to get into, for sure. 

In the past few months I haven't really written anything in this blog. When I originally created this site my plan was to showcase projects I had completed and host documentation on 
them. What I've been thinking about is the fact that I haven't produced much in the past half a year or so. I've also been thinking about the time before that, and how long it's been
since the last project I can really say I've completed. I've been in a dry spell for making for a long time now, and while I keep up on what my friends are working on, I haven't really
started anything of my own. In some ways, I guess this site was supposed to be a catalyst for that. I've been thinking maybe it still can be.

My friend/mentor/wizard [Patrick McCarthy](http://www.rothmobot.com/) (Who I feel will be mentioned countless times on this site) recently began emphasizing the importants of "notebooking"
to our teens at the [Fab Lab](http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/fab-lab/). One story in particular that stood out to me was about a guy that didn't like planning out or taking notes
at all, but forced himself to make an entry once a day in his notebook, and got some pretty stellar ideas out of it before long. I've been thinking I'd like to try something similar 
on this site. 

I want to make an entry on this site once a week. Even if it's just a concept I'm toying with in my head, even if it's just progress and not a finished product. I want to document my
WHOLE making process, not just the polished results. Many of the projects I start might fail. They might never see completion. But moving forward I have to let go of that if I want
to get out of whatever slump I've fallen into. I have to be ready to fail early and often. Somewhere along the line I feel I lost my tenacity. The drive to finish a project even when
it gets stuck. Maybe it's because my last few projects got very stuck and burned out. But I had it once, and I'm going to get it back.

I don't know if this post even makes any sense, but it's nice to get my own thoughts down, leave a reminder to myself about what I was thinking in this moment. That's the point of the
blog, in a way. 


I've been thinking, that's all.
