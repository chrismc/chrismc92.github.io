#Why hello there!


My name is Christian! I'm a Chicago native hailing from the city's lower west side, currently studying Computer Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. When I'm not busy with coursework, I volunteer for the Museum of Science and Industry's [Fab Lab](http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/fab-lab/), an educational space about the science behind digital fabrication. I fancy myself a bit of a [maker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture), and I tend to tinker and build things in my spare time. To that end, I've recently become a member of [South Side Hackerspace](http://sshchicago.org/). They're a pretty cool bunch of people, and the space is pretty well equipped for a wide variety of projects. I'm also a programmer, and have a habit of developing scripts, applications, and utilities when it strikes my fancy.

Between all these different hobbies and roles, I tend to find myself building a wide variety of projects, which is where this site comes in. Here I intend to post progress updates on anything I'm currently working on, as well as polished write-ups on the stuff I've completed. I believe one of the best things about building and making is sharing my work with the world, so I'll try my hardest to document it well. Not to mention, as the great Adam Savage once put it, "The only difference between screwing around and science is writing it down".
